This project is to play around with some "design patterns" on how
the structure of a Ruboto app could look like.
I just copied some code form the demo-android-api.rb and put it in here.
As you can see quickly, it looks pretty "railsy".


TODO:
- how do models interact with the activities lifecycle? (i.e. automatically persistet)
